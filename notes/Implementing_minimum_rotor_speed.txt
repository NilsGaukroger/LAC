Implementing minimum rotor speed

(1. Run A2/htc/redesign_struct_flex.htc with HAWC2S WITHOUT a minimum rotor speed)
(2. Compute structural and aeroelastic Campbell diagrams using HAWCStab2)
(3. Plot them using postProcessing_struct.m)
4. Decide on a minimum rotor speed from aeroelastic Campbell diagram
5. Run redesign_cont_HS2.htc with HAWC2S to create .opt file
6. Repeat steps 2 and 3 (potentially 4) with the new .opt file


NB:
If you play with wpdata, i.e. peak shaving or minimum rotor speed, you need to replot your Campbell diagrams
