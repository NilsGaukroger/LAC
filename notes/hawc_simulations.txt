Turbulent

Running simulations:
1. Plug in USB
2. Copy "LAC/hawc_simulations/" from USB to "C:\Users\s######\Documents"
3. Open make_turb.py in either Notepad or Spyder
4. Change wsps on line 49 to your wind speeds, i.e. wsps = [#, #, #, #, #]
5. Change number of random seeds per wind speed, i.e. nseeds = #
5. From C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\ open cmd
6. From cmd run: "python make_turb.py"
7. Check C:\User\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\htc_turb\ has been produced and contains the expected .htc files for all your wind speeds and random seeds
8. From cmd run: "run_turb.bat"
9. Check there are no errors (otherwise check .log file)
10. Results should be saved in a C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\res_turb\ folder

Exporting results:
1. Plug in USB
2. Copy all files (.dat and .sel for all wind speeds and random seeds) from C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\res_turb\ to USB's LAC\hawc_results\res\turb\
3. Copy all files (.log for all wind speeds) from C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\log\ to USB's LAC\hawc_results\log\turb\


Steady

Running simulations:
1. Plug in USB
2. Copy "LAC/hawc_simulations/" from USB to "C:\Users\s######\Documents"
3. Open make_steady.py in either Notepad or Spyder
4. Change wsps on line 49 to your wind speeds, i.e. wsps = [#, #, #, #, #]
5. From C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\ open cmd
6. From cmd run: "python make_steady.py"
7. Check C:\User\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\htc_steady\ has been produced and contains the expected .htc files for all your wind speeds
8. From cmd run: "run_steady.bat"
9. Check there are no errors (otherwise check .log file)
10. Results should be saved in a C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\res_steady\ folder

Exporting results:
1. Plug in USB
2. Copy all files (.dat and .sel for all wind speeds) from C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\res_steady\ to USB's LAC\hawc_results\res\steady\
3. Copy all files (.log for all wind speeds) from C:\Users\s######\Documents\hawc_simulations\log\ to USB's LAC\hawc_results\log\steady\
